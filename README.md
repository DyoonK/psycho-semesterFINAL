#Completing my final vision for my dating simulator was not possible in the alloted time frame. I severly misunderstood how setting the foundation for a game to work would take. Though I finished my Inventory States, Animation States, Collisions and Tilemaps, I was unable to go above and beyond with NPC Dialouge Interaction.

#During the project I learned the INs and Outs of the GODOT engine, and really struggled with understanding state machines for player walking states and idle animations. Though with the help of reddit and youtube videos, I was somehow able to make my code work. One thing I really struggled on was tilemaps and making the game fully realized. Learning the engine for the first time was not comfortable, as everything was a new experience. 

#My Name is Dylon Ky, I am a Freshman and I do want to be a game developer.

#I would gladly talk about my game engine and the code, but I did struggle with figuring out how to record on my PC and how to actually export a project as big as this on my github account. Thank you for your time.
